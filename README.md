-----------------------------------------------Food Ordering Appl using LINUX-GUI --------------------------------------------------

• In this project, we have taken data about restaurant management system by using shell scripting commands in Linux ubuntu (GUI). 

• The created data base will take orders of fast-food items from the customers as per their order. 

• I have included five fast food items in database they are Burger, Chicken Pizza, French Fries,Coke, and Coffee. 

• The database will ask customer to enter their needed fast-food items. 

• After purchasing the first order the database will ask the customer do you want any additional food item and as per their requirement the database will store and show the bill. 

• All data will be shown in separate GUI.

• In this project we used zenity in creation of the GUI interface
